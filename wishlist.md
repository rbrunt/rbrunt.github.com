This page has a few ideas for family looking for ideas about what we might like for Christmas / Birthday.

## Richard&apos;s Wishlist

- I have an Amazon Wishlist ([UK](https://www.amazon.co.uk/hz/wishlist/ls/2QD2WOYDBNCPQ?ref_=wl_share) / [US](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2J21GDVBO24S6?ref_=wl_share)) that I try to keep up to date with things I'd like.
- I like specialty coffee. I have a grinder, so beans are preferable.
- I like whisky, particularly bourbon and Islay single malt.
- You could buy me a book: I like thrillers, sci-fi and non-fiction books (especially history of science).
- I like photography, so canvas prints of my photos (or vouchers to do that).

## Ashley&apos;s Wishlist

Here are a few things that Ashley would like:

- Ashley has an Amazon Wishlist ([UK](https://www.amazon.co.uk/hz/wishlist/ls/15QYX7Q2ET1ZR?ref_=wl_share) / [US](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/VCE7SKQ1WBBT?ref_=wl_share)) which is normally up-to-date with ideas.
- Some Dungarees / overalls from [Lucy & Yak](https://lucyandyak.com/products/original-organic-cotton-dungarees-maroon?variant=39358815469671) (Maroon, black, or lazy daisy in size UK10/US6).
- Tea from [Whittard's](https://www.whittard.co.uk/). She particularly likes:
    - [Mango and Bergamot](https://www.whittard.co.uk/tea/tea-type/green-tea/mango-bergamot-loose-tea-MSTR314658.html)
    - [Vanilla Honeybush & Orange](https://www.whittard.co.uk/tea/vanilla-honeybush-and-orange-infusion-MSTR354233.html)
    - [Regal Blend loose tea](https://www.whittard.co.uk/tea/tea-type/black-tea/regal-blend-loose-tea-MSTR314609.html)
    - [Peppermint & Liquorice Loose Infusion](https://www.whittard.co.uk/tea/peppermint-liquorice-loose-infusion-MSTR354217.html)

## Other Ideas

- Vouchers to do something a bit 'special' together (like money towards a meal out in Oxford) always go down well.
