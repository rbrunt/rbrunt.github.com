## Amazon Wishlist

I have an [Amazon wishlist](https://www.amazon.co.uk/hz/wishlist/ls/2QD2WOYDBNCPQ?ref_=wl_share) that I try to keep up to date with things I'd like.

## Things that aren't on Amazon

I don't really like that many 'things', so consumables are always appreciated:

- I like coffee, particularly the coffee from [Missing Bean](https://www.themissingbean.co.uk/collections/coffee) in Oxford, but any specialty coffee would be very appreciated. I have a grinder, so beans are preferable.
- I like Whisky, particularly bourbon and Islay single malt.
