<p>I'm a Christian. That means that I believe that God sent his son Jesus, who was born as a man and died in our place to take the punishment we deserve for our sins.</p>

<p>That might sound a little complicated, so I'll break it down:</p>

<h2>Sin</h2>
<p>Sin is the bible's word for removing God (our creator) from his rightful place as head of our lives, and putting ourselves in his place.</p>

<blockquote><p>You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honour and power, for you created all things, and by your will they were created and have their being.</p>
<div class="blockquote-source">Revelation chapter 4, verse 11</div></blockquote>

<p>Since God created the world (an us), we should treat him as such - letting him tell us what's best for us, but ever since the fall in Genesis 3, we have essentially been saying that it is us, not him that know what's best for us, even to the point where we want to have nothing to do with him. This is what the bible calls sin.</p>
<p>This is a very offensive thing to do to God. Imagine (if you need to) that you're a parent, and that you've given your child everything they need. Now imagine how you'd feel if they took it all, then walked off, saying that they don't want to have anything to do with you any more, without even saying "thanks".</p>
<p>Now imagine how God feels - he created and sustains a beautiful world for us to live in, and we don't even acknowledge him, just take it and walk away.</p>
<blockquote><p>For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
<div class="blockquote-source">Romans chapter 6, verse 23</div></blockquote>

<p>God cannot tolerate sin. Just as a misbehaving child needs to be punished for what they've done wrong, we deserve to be punished for what we've done wrong towards God.</p>

<h2>Judgement</h2>
<blockquote><p>Man is destined to die once, and after that to face judgement.</p>
<div class="blockquote-source">Hebrews chapter 9, verse 27</div></blockquote>

<p>Since God is perfectly just, he cannot simply sweep our sin under the carpet. It must be paid</p>
