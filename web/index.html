<p>Websites are great - they're quick to make, don't rely on people having to install extra software to use, and can be incredibly useful. That's why I sometimes make them in my spare time.</p>
<p>Here's a selection of web projects I've made over the years&hellip;</p>

<p>When the pandemic hit and people in the UK weren't allowed to mix outside our households, I made a scavenger hunt around Oxford for my girlfriend. It was a great project to learn a bit more React and experiment with location aware webapps. It's also the first time I'd tried making a website with a dark mode!</p>

<p>I'm really happy with how it turned out and how well it works. If I have time I'd love to extend it to support multiple puzzles and allow users to submit their own for their cities.</p>

<p>For my University's <a href="http://diccu.co.uk/">Christian Union</a>, I designed a simple CMS to manage recordings of the events we put on. It lets you group individual talks into series, upload mp3s or a YouTube video, and let others browse through and search for talks.</p>

<h2><a href="http://diccu.co.uk/">CU Website</a></h2>

<p>I ran the website for the <a href="http://diccu.co.uk/">Christian Union</a> in Durham while I was a student there. As my first ever WordPress theme, it was a great chance to learn about WordPress theme development, and website design in general.</p>
