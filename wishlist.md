This page has a few ideas for family looking for ideas about what we might like for Christmas / Birthday.

## Richard's Wishlist

- I have an [Amazon wishlist](https://www.amazon.co.uk/hz/wishlist/ls/2QD2WOYDBNCPQ?ref_=wl_share) that I try to keep up to date with things I'd like.
- I like coffee, particularly the coffee from [Missing Bean](https://www.themissingbean.co.uk/collections/coffee) in Oxford, but any specialty coffee would be very appreciated. I have a grinder, so beans are preferable.
- I like whisky, particularly bourbon and Islay single malt.
- You could buy me a book: I like thrillers, sci-fi and non-fiction books (especially history of science).
- I like photography, so canvas prints of my photos (or vouchers to do that).

## Ashley's Wishlist

Here are a few things that Ashley would like:

- Ashley has an [Amazon Wishlist](https://www.amazon.co.uk/hz/wishlist/ls/15QYX7Q2ET1ZR?ref_=wl_share) too.
- Ashley wants a 'cozy' bath robe.
- Ashley would like [this rug from Dunelm](https://www.dunelm.com/product/geo-metallic-rug-1000194779?colour=Peacock&defaultSkuId=30752789&rugSize=120cm+x+170cm+%284ft+x+5.5ft%29) (size: 4ft x 5.5ft).
- Ashley likes tea from [Whittard's](https://www.whittard.co.uk/).

## Other Ideas

- Vouchers to do something a bit 'special' together (like money towards a meal out in Oxford) always go down well.
